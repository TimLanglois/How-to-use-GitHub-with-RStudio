You can also host websites from GitHub


Quick example:
Commit these changes to your local repo. How?

From RStudio:

Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane.
Check “Staged” box for README.md.
If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”.
Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”.
Click “Commit”.
